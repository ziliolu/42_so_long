This is my first programming graphic project!
During the development of this project, I explored the main concepts about MiniLibX library to be able to code a simple 2D game. Also, I could learn about rendering, graphic management, color schemes and sprites.

## ðŸŽ® The game

- The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell (or on the screen, for bonus!).
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile)

You can also take a look in the [complete subject]. 

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer 
Maybe you could notice a different coding style. At 42 schools we need to follow some rules like:
<p>       ðŸ—™ The usage of for, do while, switch, case is not allowed<p> 
<p>       ðŸ—™ Functions with more than 25 lines are not allowed <p> 
<p>       ðŸ—™ Variables declarations and assigns in the same line are not allowed <p> 
    


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
