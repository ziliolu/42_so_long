## About

The "so_long" project is a part of 42's curriculum and involves creating a 2D game using C programming language and the MinilibX graphic library. The game requires players to navigate through a maze, collecting items and avoiding obstacles.

The project includes learning about file descriptors (fd) and their use in reading from a map file as well as how to deal with structs. These are important concepts in C programming, and this project provides an opportunity to practice both in a fun and engaging way.

## Installation

To install and play So_long, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ziliolu/42_so_long.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile it:
  ```bash
  cd so_long && make
  ```
3. Choose a map from `maps` folder or test with your own map
  ```bash
  ./so_long maps/valid1.ber
  ```
  ```bash
  ./so_long path_to_your_own_map
  ```
## Game rules

- The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell (or on the screen, for bonus!).
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile)

## Testers 

1. [Map Validator](https://github.com/Nuno-Jesus/so_long_map_validator) serves as an essential tool to validate and verify the format and correctness of the map, guaranteeing a reliable gameplay experience.
   
## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

Maybe you could notice a different coding style.
At 42 we need to follow some rules according to the coding standard of the school such as:

```bash
- No for, do while, switch, case or goto 
- No functions with more than 25 lines 
- No more than 5 functions per each file
- No more than 5 variables in the same function
- No assigns and declarations assigns in the same line
```
