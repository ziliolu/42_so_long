This is my first programming graphic project!
During the development of this project, I explored the main concepts about MiniLibX library to be able to code a simple 2D game. Also, I could learn about rendering, graphic management, color schemes and sprites.

## ðŸŽ® The game

- The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell (or on the screen, for bonus!).
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile)

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer 
Maybe you could notice a different coding style. At 42 schools we need to follow some rules like:
<p>       ðŸ—™ The usage of for, do while, switch, case is not allowed<p> 
<p>       ðŸ—™ Functions with more than 25 lines are not allowed <p> 
<p>       ðŸ—™ Variables declarations and assigns in the same line are not allowed <p> 
    


## Installation/Compilation

To compile and run the project at the same time it's very easy, you can just follow the syntax below: 

```sh
$ make run arg=path_to_the_map_file.ber
```
Make sure you have the right path of the map, if you prefer you can also test the project with some of the maps that I have available in `/maps`. 
For this, you can run one of the following commands in the terminal: 
  
```sh
$ make run arg=valid1.ber
```
  
```sh
$ make run arg=valid2.ber
```
