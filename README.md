## About

The "so_long" project is a part of 42's curriculum and involves creating a 2D game using C programming language and the MinilibX graphic library. The game requires players to navigate through a maze, collecting items and avoiding obstacles.

The project includes learning about file descriptors (fd) and their use in reading from a map file as well as how to deal with structs. These are important concepts in C programming, and this project provides an opportunity to practice both in a fun and engaging way.
